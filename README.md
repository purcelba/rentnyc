template.html
- eliminate redundancy in pricing list
- find out how to add comma's in a form for prices

rent_app.py
- replace string sql queries with sqlalchemy commands.
- right now I am using rentnyc_sparkBoot2sql.py in the Projects/rentnyc/ directory to add the
  bootstrapped coefficients table to the data base.  This code should be cleaned up and added
  to the parallel_bootstrap folder for public consumption.
